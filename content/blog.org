My personal blog will soon be making its debut. It will be rudimentary, probably just a top-down chronological list of posts, until 育賢老師 writes some fancy-schmancy blog functionality.
The name you see above was initially thought to serve as a mere transient vanity plate. However, at the behest of encouragement from my peers, I have decided that czubicle is rather too clever to pass up.
